1) TensorFlow:
  - it is a deep learning framework developed by Google Brain Team.
  - it is used to build deep learning and neural network models to gain insights from unstructured data, such as
    images, audio, and natural language.
  - it can use GPU and TPU for faster computation.
  - get data -> tensorflow hub(pick a model - transfer learning) -> fit the model -> evaluate the model -> improve  and savead reload the model.
  - pathway:
      - image classification
      - object detection
      - natural language processing
      - speech recognition
      - sequence-to-sequence models
